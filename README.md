# Playlist_Capital_One

A one page app written in React that displays a list of songs for a given year when the relevant button is clicked, a tech test for Capital One.

## To use:

```
git clone https://github.com/noel1uk/Playlist_Capital_One.git
npm start
```

## To run tests:

```
npm test
```

## To check coverage:

```
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Approach
#### Planning: 
Read through starting docs at https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html and experimented with components.

##### Sketch:

##### Components:

* Then I broke this down into the components: Catalogue, YearButtonColumn, YearButton, SongsList, SongDetails.

##### TDD:

Using Jest and Enzyme I intend to take a test driven approach wherever possible.
